**DDA** stands for Device Defender Audit.<br>
The Topic and Role used below were created during the preparation.
{{% /notice %}}
4. Choose **Enabled** 
5. Locate the Topic `DDA_Findings` clicking on **Select**
6. Locate the Role containing `DDAtoSNSRole` clicking on **Select**
7. Choose **Update**
![SetupSns3](/images/20_workshop_setup_sns_03.png)

You have configured AWS IoT Device Defender Audit to send SNS messages to the specific Topic.

## Understanding the SNS Event Generated by AWS IoT Device Defender

Once configured, AWS IoT Device Defender will run an Audit on the scheduled frequency and send Findings to the SNS topic you have configured. SNS will forward the message the Lambda mitigation function adding an envelope with Metadata such as `EventVersion`, `SignatureVersion`, `Timestamp` as showed on the example below.

```json
{
  "Records": [
    {
      "EventVersion": "1.0",
      "EventSubscriptionArn": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:xxxxxxxxxxxx:DevDefenderAudit:152befa1-d830-4ccc-9bc7-5f790d6273db",
      "EventSource": "aws:sns",
      "Sns": {
        "SignatureVersion": "1",
        "Timestamp": "2019-10-25T14:19:33.294Z",
        "Signature": "pT0gOsvH/3SR9njmno+m2iv9jt4D1BNnkASEtt0On90KD6sI5m9LuZPRvfwZPRuBb0M9mE5IKJYaMW1GUU28+Sr50YfKpJnpQ8HBA38lU/2eQ/PKiUal4ATXX3C3EilOYo5kLZHiIhn1wzocwJhnlgZnQUTHBLvcBiCIYbx2MnfJm2cJWy7NtExZMeNk/11PKHXqE71m7K/gDXfU6SvJr1iRTv5hQs3QLhO/qUrB9k46V1iuthzU0lqVL4l161s7kAxSmGccMvkWqY2Sa+OP+qn2POGUR9nMm7ev3HPz84qNv4oYddl8y0V+xXCF61bk5IY7Hv+DUW4zbIMI7NYo8g==",
        "SigningCertUrl": "https://sns.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/
        SimpleNotificationService-6aad65c2f9911b05cd53efda11f913f9.pem",
        "MessageId": "e98d6ec4-a3b9-5e3e-a0c5-38e9a50cc829",
        "Message": "{\"accountId\":\"xxxxxxxxxxxx\",\"taskId\":\"7aa53579303b594f9bcb76082688a5de\",\"taskStatus\":\"COMPLETED\",\"taskType\":\"ON_DEMAND_AUDIT_TASK\",\"failedChecksCount\":0,\"canceledChecksCount\":0,\"nonCompliantChecksCount\":1,\"compliantChecksCount\":0,\"totalChecksCount\":1,\"taskStartTime\":1572013171897,\"auditDetails\":[{\"checkName\":\"IOT_POLICY_OVERLY_PERMISSIVE_CHECK\",\"checkRunStatus\":\"COMPLETED_NON_COMPLIANT\",\"nonCompliantResourcesCount\":2,\"totalResourcesCount\":5}]}",
        "MessageAttributes": {},
        "Type": "Notification",
        "UnsubscribeUrl": "https://sns.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/?Action=Unsubscribe&SubscriptionArn=arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:xxxxxxxxxxxx:DevDefenderAudit:152befa1-d830-4ccc-9bc7-5f790d6273db",
        "TopicArn": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:xxxxxxxxxxxx:DevDefenderAudit",
        "Subject": null
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The relevant information is at `['Records'][0]['Sns']['Message']` and you can get it with the following sample code.

```python
    ...
    message = event['Records'][0]['Sns']['Message']
    print("From SNS: " + message)
    ...
```

This is an example of a `IOT_POLICY_OVERLY_PERMISSIVE_CHECK` message.

```json
{
    "accountId": "xxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "taskId": "7aa53579303b594f9bcb76082688a5de",
    "taskStatus": "COMPLETED",
    "taskType": "ON_DEMAND_AUDIT_TASK",
    "failedChecksCount": 0,
    "canceledChecksCount": 0,
    "nonCompliantChecksCount": 1,
    "compliantChecksCount": 0,
    "totalChecksCount": 1,
    "taskStartTime": 1572013171897,
    "auditDetails": [
        {
            "checkName": "IOT_POLICY_OVERLY_PERMISSIVE_CHECK",
            "checkRunStatus": "COMPLETED_NON_COMPLIANT",
            "nonCompliantResourcesCount": 2,
            "totalResourcesCount": 5
        }
    ]
}
```

So now that you know how to get the Findings (`checkName` and `status`) from AWS IoT Device Defender, you can automate the remediation actions.

## Understanding the AWS Lambda Function

The Lambda function receives an SNS message, extracts the envelope, and gets the audit `taskId` for querying the findings details later.

```python
    ...
    msg = json.loads(event['Message'])
    task_id = msg['taskId']
    ...
```

Then it determines whether the results contain a noncompliant check.

```python
    ... 
    for audit in msg['auditDetails']:

        if audit['checkRunStatus'] != "COMPLETED_COMPLIANT":
            logger.info("ERROR: {}".format(audit['checkName']))
    ... 
```

The function processes only overly permissive policy findings (`IOT_POLICY_OVERLY_PERMISSIVE_CHECK`), but you can add other handlers to different issues.

```python
    ...
    if audit['checkName'] == "IOT_POLICY_OVERLY_PERMISSIVE_CHECK":
        handle_overly_permissive_policy(task_id)
    else:
        handle_security_issue(task_id, issue_name)
    ...
```

To handle permissive issues, the function queries the AWS IoT Device Defender findings and iterates over them.

```python
    ...
    r = iot.list_audit_findings(taskId=task_id, checkName='IOT_POLICY_OVERLY_PERMISSIVE_CHECK')

    for f in r['findings']:
        resource = f['nonCompliantResource']
    ...       
```

To avoid changing existing policies provisioned on the account, the sample code acts only on the policies created with a specific prefix, in this case, `WS_AUDIT_`. Additionally, the permissions attached to the Lambda function allow updates only on the permissive AWS IoT policy.

```python
    ...     
    if policy_name.startswith(TARGET_POLICY_NAME_PREFIX):
        fix_overly_permissive_policy(policy_name, policy_version)
    ...    
```
 
It will change the current permissive policy to the following pre-defined restrictive policy, which allows a device to manipulate only its own shadow.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "ConnectUsingClientId",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "iot:Connect",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:iot:*:*:client/${iot:Connection.Thing.ThingName}",
            "Condition": {
                "Bool": { "iot:Connection.Thing.IsAttached": "true" }
            }
        },
        {
            "Sid": "UpdateAndQueryOwnShadow",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iot:Publish"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:iot:*:*:topic/$aws/things/${iot:Connection.Thing.ThingName}/shadow/update",
                "arn:aws:iot:*:*:topic/$aws/things/${iot:Connection.Thing.ThingName}/shadow/get"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Sid": "ReceiveShadowChanges",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iot:Subscribe",
                "iot:Receive"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:iot:*:*:topicfilter/$aws/things/${iot:Connection.Thing.ThingName}/shadow/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

The functionÂ `fix_overly_permissive_policy()` contains the code to fix this issue. It handles a few different situations, but the main idea is to delete the offending policy, and replace it with a new default one with restrictive permissions.

```python
def fix_overly_permissive_policy(policy_name, policy_version):
    ...
    r = iot.delete_policy_version(
        policyName=policy_name,
        policyVersionId=policy_version
    )
    ...
    r = iot.create_policy_version(
        policyName=policy_name,
        policyDocument=RESTRICTIVE_DEFAULT_POLICY,
        setAsDefault=True
    )
    ...

```

{{% notice warning %}}
This sample function will work for a few issues. If you need to address many issues at a time, you can decouple the results analysis from the remediation using, for example, Amazon SQS.
{{% /notice %}}

## Understanding the Function Permissions and Role

You are concerned with the security of the Role solution and you know you should use the **Least Privilege Principle** to create the permissions attached to the Role used by your Lambda function.

The lambda function requires some basic permissions for creating Log Groups, Streams and send data to Cloudwatch Logs. The following snippet describes a sample policy.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "logs:CreateLogGroup",
                "logs:CreateLogStream",
                "logs:PutLogEvents"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

The lambda function also needs to execute a few operations related to the steps you saw on the previous session such as List Audit Tasks, Create Policy Version, Delete a Policy Version and Change the Default Policy Version. You can notice that the names of the methods on `AWS IoT SDK` usually have similar names to the permissions, so it should be easy to identify them. For example, `iot.list_audit_findings()` requires the permission `iot:ListAuditFindings`.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "iot:DescribeAccountAuditConfiguration",
                "iot:DescribeAuditTask",
                "iot:ListAuditTasks",
                "iot:ListScheduledAudits",
                "iot:ListAuditFindings"
            ],
            "Resource": "*",
            "Effect": "Allow"
        },
        {
            "Action": [
                "iot:CreatePolicyVersion",
                "iot:DeletePolicyVersion",
                "iot:ListPolicyVersions",
                "iot:SetDefaultPolicyVersion"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:iot:*:*:policy/AUDIT_WS_*",
            "Effect": "Allow"
        },
        {
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:GetObject"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::dreis-sandbox-temp/*",
            "Effect": "Allow"
        },
        {
            "Action": "iam:PassRole",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::*:role/*",
            "Effect": "Allow"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Configuring the AWS Lambda Function Trigger

You have configured AWS IoT Device Defender Audit to send events to SNS. Now, you need to configure the trigger which will execute the lambda function when events arrive on SNS.

1. Open AWS Lambda console
![LambdaTrigger](/images/20_lambda_configure_trigger_01.png)
1. Choose the `DDAFindingsProcessor` Lambda Function
![LambdaTrigger](/images/20_lambda_configure_trigger_02.png)
1. Choose **+ Add trigger**
![LambdaTrigger](/images/20_lambda_configure_trigger_03.png)
1. For **Trigger** type `SNS`
1. Choose SNS
![LambdaTrigger](/images/20_lambda_configure_trigger_04.png)
1. Locate the Topic with `DDA_Findings`
1. Check if the trigger is enabled
1. Choose **Add**
![LambdaTrigger](/images/20_lambda_configure_trigger_05.png)

You have finished the configuration of the solution. Now it is time to test it!

## Examining the Sample Permissive AWS IoT Policy

You have finished the setup and can check if it works as expected. You will create a permissive AWS IoT policy that will trigger AWS IoT Device Defender after running an audit. The JSON below shows the sample policy.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": [
        "iot:Connect",
        "iot:Publish",
        "iot:Subscribe",
        "iot:Receive"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "*"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow"
    }
  ]
}
``` 

This policy doesnât comply with the best practices because it has very broad permissions. For example, the actions arenât constrained to specific resources. This allows a device using this policy to publish messages to any topicÂ and potentially interfere with other devices. You can find more [information about the analysis performed by AWS IoT Device Defender here] (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/device-defender-audit.html).

In a production environment, you should follow a least-privilege policy by default, that is, your device should have only the permissions required to complete its activities. Continuous auditing can help you detect and take action in the event a policy has been created that isn't in line with best practices.

## Creating a Sample Permissive AWS IoT Policy

1. Open AWS IoT Console
1. Choose **Secure** then **Policies**
1. Choose **Create**
![SetupSns2](/images/20_workshop_create_policy_01.png)
1. For **Name** type `WS_AUDIT_PermissivePolicy`
1. Choose **Advanced mode**
![SetupSns2](/images/20_workshop_create_policy_02.png)
1. Copy the Policy below and paste it on **Add statements**

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": [
        "iot:Connect",
        "iot:Publish",
        "iot:Subscribe",
        "iot:Receive"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "*"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow"
    }
  ]
}
```

1. Choose **Create**

<details><summary>**Using AWS CLI in Cloud9**</summary>
<p>

```
# Creating a permissive Policy
$ aws iot create-policy \
    --policy-name "WS_AUDIT_PermissivePolicy" \
    --policy-document "{\"Version\":\"2012-10-17\",\"Statement\":{\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Action\":[\"iot:Connect\", \"iot:Publish\",\"iot:Subscribe\",\"iot:Receive\"],\"Resource\":\"*\"}}"
```

Output example:
```
aws iot create-policy \
    --policy-name "WS_AUDIT_PermissivePolicy" \
    --policy-document "{\"Version\":\"2012-10-17\",\"Statement\":{\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Action\":[\"iot:Connect\", \"iot:Publish\",\"iot:Subscribe\",\"iot:Receive\"],\"Resource\":\"*\"}}"
```

</p>
</details>

## Starting an On-Demand Audit

After creating a permissive policy, you will run an on-demand audit to check if the remediation strategy is working. Each completed audit task will trigger the Lambda function. 

To complete this task, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS IoT Core console
1. In the left navigation pane, choose **Defend** and then **Audit**
1. Choose **Schedules**
1. On the upper right, choose **Create**
1. Select only **IoT policies overly permissive**. You can use AWS IoT Device Defender to create separated schedules for each type of check. For example, a daily audit for **Device certificate shared** and a weekly audit for **CA Certificates expiring**
1. Scroll to the **Set Schedule** session.
1. Choose **Run audit now (once)**.
1. Choose **Create** to start the audit.

<details><summary>**Using AWS CLI in Cloud9**</summary>
<p>
To start an on-demand audit task, enter this command:
```bash
$ aws iot start-on-demand-audit-task \
    --target-check-names IOT_POLICY_OVERLY_PERMISSIVE_CHECK
```

Output example:
```bash
$ aws iot start-on-demand-audit-task \
    --target-check-names IOT_POLICY_OVERLY_PERMISSIVE_CHECK
{
    "taskId": "660b1f3a889a894f8877958f1550f6b7"
}
```

</p>
</details>

## Checking the Audit Progress

Depending on the number of devices and checks selected, the Audit execution can take more time to finish. You can follow the progress using the console or the APIs.

1. Open the AWS IoT console
2. In the left navigation pane, choose **Defend** and then **Audit**
3. Choose **Results**
4. Choose the audit you created
5. Check the results
6. Choose the check name **IoT policies overly permissive** to see a detailed report

![LambdaTrigger](/images/20_workshop_audit_progress_01.png)

<details><summary>**Using AWS CLI in Cloud9**</summary>
<p>

To describe an audit task, enter this command:
```bash
$ aws iot describe-audit-task \
    --task-id <task-id>
```

</p>
</details>

## Validating the Mitigation Action

After completing the audit, the AWS Lambda function is triggeredÂ andÂ updates the target policy. You can check that the mitigation strategy was successfulÂ by looking at the policy in the console.

To complete this task, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS IoT Core console
1. In the left navigation pane, choose **Secure**, and then choose **Policies**
1. Search for the specific policy by using the text box. For example, `WS_AUDIT_PermissivePolicy`
1. Click on the **Search Icon**
1. Choose the policy displayed on the right panel
1. Scroll down to locate the **Policy Document** section
1. Check that the policy document was updated with the restrictive policy you configured

<details><summary>**Using AWS CLI in Cloud9**</summary>
<p>
To describe an IoT policy, enter this command:
```bash
$ aws iot get-policy \
    --policy-name <policy-name> \
    --query "policyDocument"
```

Sample output:

```bash
$ aws iot get-policy \
    --policy-name AUDIT_WS_PermissivePolicy \
    --query "policyDocument" \
    --output text | jq .
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": [
      ],
      "Resource": "*",
      "Effect": "Allow"
    }
  ]
}
```

</p>
</details>

## Conclusion

You learned how to set up AWS IoT Device Defender Audit, understand the payloads generated by this service, work with a Lambda function to create an automated mitigation strategy!
